<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Urea Breath Test System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Scintillation Technology</li><li>Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Urea Breath Test Systems are used to detect the presence of Helicobacter pylori bacteria in the stomach. There are two main types of Urea Breath Test Systems: Scintillation Technology and Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry. </p><p>Scintillation Technology involves measuring the radiation emitted when a patient ingests a urea solution containing a radioactive isotope. Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry measures the ratio of carbon isotopes in exhaled breath samples after a patient ingests a non-radioactive urea solution. Both methods are highly accurate and widely used in medical facilities for diagnosing H. pylori infections.</p></p>
