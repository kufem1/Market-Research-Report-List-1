<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photodegradable Plastic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Copolymer</li><li>Additive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photodegradable plastic is a type of plastic that can break down into smaller particles when exposed to sunlight. There are two main types of photodegradable plastics: copolymer-based and additive-based. Copolymer-based photodegradable plastics are made by blending different types of polymers together to create a material that can break down under sunlight. Additive-based photodegradable plastics, on the other hand, are regular plastics that have additives mixed in to make them degrade when exposed to sunlight. Both types of photodegradable plastics offer a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional plastics as they can reduce waste accumulation.</p></p>
