<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory-grown Diamonds (LGDs) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CVD</li><li>HPHT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laboratory-grown diamonds (LGDs) are diamonds that are created in a controlled environment rather than mined from the earth. There are two main types of LGDs on the market: Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and High Pressure High Temperature (HPHT). CVD diamonds are grown using a process where carbon atoms are deposited onto a substrate, while HPHT diamonds are created by subjecting a diamond seed to high pressure and high temperature. Both types of LGDs offer consumers a more sustainable and ethical alternative to mined diamonds.</p></p>
