<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Photoresist Chemicals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Photoresist chemicals are used in the semiconductor industry for photolithography processes. There are two main types of photoresists - positive and negative. Positive photoresists become more soluble after exposure to light, making the exposed areas easier to remove during development. Negative photoresists, on the other hand, become less soluble when exposed to light, so the unexposed areas are removed during development. Both types play crucial roles in creating precise patterns on semiconductor substrates for the fabrication of electronic devices.</p></p>
