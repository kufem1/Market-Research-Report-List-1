<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transportation Composites Material Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic</li><li>Thermoset</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transportation composites materials come in two main types: thermoplastic and thermoset. Thermoplastic composites are made from polymer resins that become soft and moldable when heated, allowing them to be easily shaped and then reformed when cooled. Thermoset composites, on the other hand, are made from resins that harden irreversibly when cured, resulting in strong and durable materials. Both types of composites are used in the transportation industry for their lightweight, high strength, and corrosion-resistant properties.</p></p>
