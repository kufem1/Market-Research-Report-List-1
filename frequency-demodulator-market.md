<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Frequency Demodulator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Slope FM Detector</li><li>Coincidence FM Demodulator</li><li>Ratio Detector</li><li>Phase Locked Loop FM Demodulator</li><li>Quadrature FM Demodulator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Frequency demodulators are used to convert frequency-modulated (FM) signals back to their original analog audio signals. The various types of frequency demodulators include Slope FM Detector, Coincidence FM Demodulator, Ratio Detector, Phase Locked Loop FM Demodulator, and Quadrature FM Demodulator. Slope FM Detector detects changes in frequency based on the slope of the input signal. Coincidence FM Demodulator uses a series of coincidence circuits to demodulate the signal. Ratio Detector compares the input frequency with a reference frequency. Phase Locked Loop FM Demodulator locks onto the phase of the input signal. Quadrature FM Demodulator processes signals across two paths to demodulate the frequency. Each of these market types offers unique advantages for demodulating FM signals.</p></p>
