<p><strong>The Axial Bone Densitometry Measurement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)</li><li>Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Axial bone densitometry measurements are used to assess bone density and strength, helping to diagnose and monitor conditions such as osteoporosis. The two main types of axial bone densitometry are Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) and Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT). DEXA is the most common method, using low-dose X-rays to measure bone density at specific sites. QCT involves a CT scan to measure bone density in the spine or hip. Both methods provide valuable information for managing bone health and assessing fracture risk.</p></p>
