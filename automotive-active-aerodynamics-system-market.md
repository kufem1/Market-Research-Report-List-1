<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Active Aerodynamics System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PAA</li><li>ALA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Automotive Active Aerodynamics Systems market is segmented into two main types: Passive Aerodynamics Systems (PAA) and Active Aerodynamics Systems (ALA). PAA systems are fixed and do not change shape or position while the vehicle is in use. On the other hand, ALA systems are dynamic and can adjust their shape and position in real time to optimize aerodynamic efficiency. ALA systems typically provide better performance and fuel efficiency compared to PAA systems, making them a popular choice in the automotive industry.</p></p>
