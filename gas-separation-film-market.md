<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Separation Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hollow Fiber</li><li>Spiral Wound</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas separation films are categorized into three main types: hollow fiber, spiral wound, and others. </p><p>Hollow fiber films consist of thousands of small hollow fibers bundled together, allowing gases to pass through while separating them based on their size and properties. Spiral wound films are made by wrapping a permeable membrane around a central tube, creating a compact and efficient structure for gas separation. The "others" category includes different types of gas separation films that do not fit into the hollow fiber or spiral wound categories.</p></p>
