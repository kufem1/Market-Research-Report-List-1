<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle RFID Tag Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>RFID tags for vehicles come in two main types - Active and Passive. Active RFID tags require an internal power source, which allows them to transmit data over longer distances and provide real-time tracking capabilities. Passive RFID tags, on the other hand, do not require a power source and instead rely on the energy from the RFID reader to transmit data. Passive tags are typically less expensive and have a shorter read range compared to active tags. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different applications within the vehicle RFID tag market.</p></p>
