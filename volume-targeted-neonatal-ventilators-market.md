<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Volume Targeted Neonatal Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilators</li><li>Non-Invasive Ventilators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Volume targeted neonatal ventilators are essential respiratory devices used in neonatal intensive care units to provide mechanical ventilation support to newborns with respiratory distress. These ventilators can be categorized into two main types: invasive ventilators, which require intubation and connect to the airway, and non-invasive ventilators, which deliver respiratory support through interfaces like nasal prongs or masks. Both types of ventilators deliver controlled volumes of air to the lungs, helping improve oxygenation and ventilation in premature or sick newborns.</p></p>
