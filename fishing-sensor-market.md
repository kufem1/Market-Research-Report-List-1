<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fishing Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Frequency</li><li>Dual Frequency</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single frequency fishing sensors operate at one frequency, typically between 50-200 kHz, and are able to penetrate deeper depths but with less resolution. Dual frequency fishing sensors operate at two frequencies, one for higher resolution and one for deeper penetration. Dual frequency sensors are able to provide a better balance between depth and resolution compared to single frequency sensors. Both types of fishing sensors are commonly used by fishermen to detect fish and underwater structures in different depths and conditions.</p></p>
