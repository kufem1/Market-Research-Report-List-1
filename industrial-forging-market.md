<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Forging Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Forging</li><li>Warm Forging</li><li>Cold Forging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial forging is a manufacturing process that involves shaping metal through the application of pressure and heat. Hot forging involves heating the metal to a high temperature before shaping it, while warm forging involves heating the metal to a lower temperature. Cold forging, on the other hand, does not involve heating the metal and instead relies on pressure alone to shape the material. Each type of forging has its own advantages and applications, depending on the desired properties of the final product.</p></p>
