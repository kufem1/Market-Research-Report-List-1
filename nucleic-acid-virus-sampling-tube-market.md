<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nucleic Acid Virus Sampling Tube Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inactivated</li><li>Non-inactivated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The nucleic acid virus sampling tube market can be categorized into two types: inactivated and non-inactivated. Inactivated sampling tubes are pre-treated with a chemical agent to deactivate the virus, making it non-infectious. This type of tube is used for safe handling and transportation of samples, ensuring minimal risk of exposure to the virus. On the other hand, non-inactivated sampling tubes contain live, infectious viruses. These tubes are used when the virus needs to remain active for further analysis or experimentation. Understanding these market types is crucial for selecting the appropriate tube for specific applications.</p></p>
