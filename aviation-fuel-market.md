<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aviation Fuel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Dye</li><li>Liquid Dye</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aviation fuel markets are divided into two main types based on the presence of dyes: solid dye and liquid dye. Solid dye aviation fuel is dyed during the refining process and remains colored throughout use, allowing for easy identification. Liquid dye aviation fuel, on the other hand, is colorless during production but can be dyed later for identification purposes. Both types play a crucial role in ensuring the safety and efficiency of aircraft operations by facilitating proper fuel management and preventing contamination.</p></p>
