<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Workspace Delivery Network Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Traditional WAN</li><li>SD-WAN</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The traditional WAN (Wide Area Network) refers to the conventional networking approach where data is transmitted over dedicated private lines or public internet connections. On the other hand, SD-WAN (Software-Defined WAN) is a newer technology that utilizes software to control and manage the network, allowing for more flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. SD-WAN abstracts the underlying network infrastructure, providing organizations with centralized control and visibility. Both types serve the purpose of connecting multiple workspaces and delivering data, but SD-WAN offers additional benefits through software-defined management.</p></p>
