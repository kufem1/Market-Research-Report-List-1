<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endotracheal Suctioning Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed System</li><li>Open System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Endotracheal suctioning devices are used to clear secretions from a patient's airway. Closed system suctioning devices have a catheter that is enclosed in a protective sheath, reducing the risk of contamination. Open system suctioning devices do not have a protective sheath, posing a higher risk of contamination. Closed system devices are preferred in settings where infection control is crucial, while open system devices may be used when immediate access to the airway is necessary. Both systems have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific needs of the patient and healthcare setting.</p></p>
