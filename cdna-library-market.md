<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The cDNA Library Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phage Library</li><li>Plasmid Library</li></ul></p>
<p><p>cDNA libraries are commonly used tools in molecular biology for gene expression studies. There are different types of cDNA libraries, including phage library and plasmid library. A phage library is created by inserting cDNA fragments into the genome of bacteriophages, which can then be used to infect bacteria and produce multiple copies of the inserted cDNA. On the other hand, a plasmid library involves inserting cDNA fragments into plasmids, which are small, circular DNA molecules that can replicate independently in bacteria. Both types of libraries enable researchers to store and study large collections of cDNA sequences.</p></p>
