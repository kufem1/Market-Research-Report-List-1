<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aerospace Adhesives and Sealants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reactive Adhesives</li><li>Non-Reactive Adhesives</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Aerospace adhesives and sealants market is categorized into two main types: Reactive Adhesives and Non-Reactive Adhesives. Reactive adhesives cure and harden through a chemical reaction, creating a strong bond. They are often used in structural applications. Non-Reactive adhesives, on the other hand, do not chemically change during bonding and rely on physical bonding mechanisms. They are commonly used for temporary fastening or sealing applications. Both types play a crucial role in aerospace manufacturing, ensuring the integrity and reliability of aircraft components.</p></p>
