<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hemoperfusion Apparatus Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resin Carbon</li><li>Activated Carbon</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Hemoperfusion Apparatus market comprises two main types of materials: resin carbon and activated carbon. Resin carbon is a type of carbon material that is widely used in hemoperfusion devices due to its high porosity and ability to adsorb toxins and impurities from the blood. Activated carbon, on the other hand, is a highly porous form of carbon that has been processed to increase its surface area, making it an effective adsorbent for a wide range of organic and inorganic substances. Both resin carbon and activated carbon play a crucial role in purifying blood during hemoperfusion treatments.</p></p>
